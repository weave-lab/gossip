gossip
======

SIP stack in Golang, for use by stateful SIP UAs, whether client, server, or proxy.


Project status
--------------

**Version: V0.2**

Gossip is now capable of basic SIP 2.0 transactions over UDP and TCP and has been live tested with real softphones.
It is still missing some compatibility features, isn't well tested and has a few known bugs.

**APIs will change without warning until V1.0.**

This readme will be updated as work progresses.
